# Vandana Rangaswamy

Hi, I’m Vandana. I’m a graduate student at **Northeastern University, Boston**, where I’m pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems. Over the past few years, I’ve built my experience around **backend development, automation, and machine learning**.  

I enjoy solving problems that sit at the intersection of **software engineering and data-driven systems**—whether that’s automating a testing workflow, building scalable applications, or experimenting with ML models that improve real-world performance.  

I’ve had the chance to work at **Caterpillar Inc.**, where I developed tools for autonomous vehicle systems, streamlined testing workflows, and worked on machine learning models for predictive performance. That experience shaped the way I approach problems—focusing not just on code, but also on **efficiency, reliability, and long-term impact**.  

I’m now looking for opportunities to apply these skills to meaningful projects in software engineering and machine learning, where I can contribute and grow.

## Skills I Work With  

- **Languages**: Python, C++, Java, SQL, Ruby, Shell/Bash  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: ROS, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Boost Test  
- **Databases & Architecture**: MongoDB, MySQL, Client-Server, Socket Programming  
- **DevOps & Cloud**: Docker, Jenkins, Linux, Git, CI/CD, Azure DevOps  
- **Testing & Tools**: SIL/HIL Testing, Pytest, REST APIs, PowerBI

## Experience  

### Caterpillar Inc. – Automation Engineer (Sep 2023 – Jun 2024)  
I built automation tools for ROS-based autonomous vehicle systems, which increased testing throughput by 35%. I also integrated CAN bus communication across multiple subsystems, improving diagnostic accuracy by 40%. A big part of my role involved performance profiling and debugging, which helped reduce system response time by 18%.  

### Caterpillar Inc. – Software Intern (Mar 2023 – Aug 2023)  
As an intern, I focused on automation and testing. I automated several workflows (cutting down manual work by 45%) and wrote unit tests that boosted code coverage by over 50%. One of my favorite projects was developing a CNN model that helped predict operational performance in self-driving trucks with 76% accuracy.

## Projects  

- **[EduAid](https://github.com/vandanarangaswamyy/FinalProject)**  
  A Java Swing application with role-based access control, designed to handle student requests across different university services.  

- **[Recruitment Management System](https://github.com/vandanarangaswamyy/Recruitment-Management-System)**  
  A system built with SQL and PowerBI to streamline recruitment workflows, track applications, and visualize metrics.  

- **Decentralized Restaurant Recommendation System**  
  A hybrid system combining machine learning, sentiment analysis, and blockchain. It recommends restaurants based on location and user sentiment, and even rewards users with tokens via MetaMask.

## Publication  

- **[Cyberbullying Detection Systems – A Survey](https://ijarcce.com/papers/cyberbullying-detection-systems-a-survey-on-methodologies-and-challenges/)**  
  I co-authored this paper, which explores how different ML/NLP models (like BERT, SVM, and Naïve Bayes) perform in detecting harmful content on social media.

## Outside of Work  

I enjoy volunteering and contributing to community activities outside of academics and work.  

I’ve also been involved in organizing college festivals, which turned out to be a hands-on lesson in teamwork, deadlines, and creative chaos.  

Lately, I’ve discovered an interest in photography, and I keep telling myself it’s time to reconnect with my painting phase.
